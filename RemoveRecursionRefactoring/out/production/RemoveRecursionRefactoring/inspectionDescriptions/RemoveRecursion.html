Reports recursive calls which may exhaust stack space. Methods which make recursive calls can be replaced with methods that don't make
recursive calls, by simulating the call stack in the user program code. The initial method code is replaced with a while statement
containing a switch statement that jumps between basic blocks of code in the original method.
