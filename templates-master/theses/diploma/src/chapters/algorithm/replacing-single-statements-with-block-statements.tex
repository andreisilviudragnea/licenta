\section{Replacing single statements with block statements}

Given the fact that Java allows some statements to appear outside of a block, they may cause problems in later steps of
the algorithm when processing the statements of a block. For example, if a new statement needs to be added before or
after another statement which is not part of a block, the initial statement needs to be first enclosed in a block, in
which the other statement will be added at the right place. The places where this pass is applied are the branches of
\code{if} statements and the bodies of \code{for}, \code{while}, \code{do-while} and \code{foreach} statements
which contain single statements. This pass also transforms statements which may not contain recursive calls, because
there are elements which the refactoring will alter in order to remove recursion and they are not only method calls (for
example, \code{return} statements). An example is provided in \labelindexref{Figure}{img:replace-single-statements-with-block-statements-before}
(before) and \labelindexref{Figure}{img:replace-single-statements-with-block-statements-after} (after).
