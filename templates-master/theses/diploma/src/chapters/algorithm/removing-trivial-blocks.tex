\section{Removing trivial blocks}

A \textit{trivial block} is defined as a block which is not the first block (having \code{id} equal to \code{0}) and
contains only an \code{UnconditionalJumpStatement}. These blocks can be removed be making the incoming blocks jump
directly to the block to which the trivial block jumps. A trivial block can appear, for example, when the last statement
in the body of a loop is an \code{if} statement. Thus the \code{mergeBlock} of the \code{if} statement contains only an
\code{UnconditionalJumpStatement} to the \code{actualUpdateBlock}.

An example of this pass is provided in \labelindexref{Figure}{img:remove-trivial}. The block with \code{id} equal to
\code{5} is trivial and it gets removed by making the incoming blocks (with ids \code{6} and \code{7}) jump directly to
the block to which the trivial block jumps, namely the block with \code{id} equal to \code{1}.
