\section{Extracting recursive calls to statements}

This pass extracts recursive calls in the method body to separate statements (variable declaration statements with the
initializer as the method call), if the call is not already the initializer of a variable declaration statement or
an assignment expression having a expression statement as parent. The pass does not affect recursive methods with
\code{void} return type, because the recursive calls to these methods are already part of a separate expression
statement.
