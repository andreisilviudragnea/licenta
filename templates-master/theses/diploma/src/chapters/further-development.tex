\chapter{Further development}

The refactoring does not support \code{try} statements in the method body, given the complex control flow involving
these statements. They can however be supported by the refactoring with some more effort, but they are not usually used
in the context of recursive methods. Recursive calls inside switch statements are not supported either, because they are
rather uncommon.

A special case to be considered is \texit{tail recursion}. In the case of tail recursive methods, that is methods
whose last statement is a recursive call, they can have the recursion removed by placing the body of the method inside a
\code{while} loop and then replacing the \code{return} statements with assignments to the formal parameters of the
method, ensuring that the order of assignments respects the order of evaluation of the arguments to the recursive call.
Auxiliary variables can be used here, if necessary. In the case of tail recursive methods with \code{void} return type,
the transformation is more complicated because it is difficult to determine the last statement executed on each code
path in the method body, as opposed to methods with no \code{void} return type, where the last statements executed on
each code path are explicit \code{return} statements.
