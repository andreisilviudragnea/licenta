\chapter{Conclusion}

The algorithm for transforming recursion in iteration is composed of thirteen passes which gradually transform the body
of the method. The end result is a method which is functionally equivalent to the initial method, but the recursion does
not take place implicitly, but explicitly by simulating it in the user program with a stack of frames. This is how
\code{StackOverflowError}s can be avoided, at the cost of obfuscating the code.
