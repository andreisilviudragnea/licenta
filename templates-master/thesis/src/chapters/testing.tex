\chapter{Testing}

Each of the thirteen steps of the algorithm have been tested independently, by developing a code inspection for each
one. Testing a code inspection involves writing a unit test which applies the inspection on an input file and then
compares the result on an expected output file. The tested inspection runs as part of an instance of the IDE without
a Graphical User Interface. These tests verify that each step of the algorithm modifies only what it states to do and
nothing else.

There are also unit tests which test the refactoring algorithm as a whole. These tests verify that the refactored
recursive methods preserve their original semantics.
