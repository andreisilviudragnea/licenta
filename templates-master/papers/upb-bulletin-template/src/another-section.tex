\begin{remark}
  {
    \rm We emphasize the theories of Nesterov and Nemirovsky which
    use this class of functions for developing linear and convex quadratic
    programs with convex quadratic constraints, and Udri»ôte's works
    which develop barrier methods for smooth convex
    programming on Riemannian manifolds.
